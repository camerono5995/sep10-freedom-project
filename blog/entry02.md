# What i found and how i found it
##### 11/4/24
### Context:
Some ways I have been researching information about hard and software is by using Google. To look up information about the software I researched "What kind of software do motivational speakers use?" the results I got were "presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides allows you to create visually compelling slideshows to accompany your speech." But this was not exactly what I was looking for so I switched up my research wording. I decided to search "What kind of apps do motivational speakers use" Then I was able to find better results of the information I was looking for. A link I found about software for my project was[skill hub,](https://speakerhub.com/skillcamp/speakers-toolkit-must-have-tech-and-apps-modern-presenters)[ peptalk,](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peptalk-daily-self-motivation/id976885594)[ Virtual speech.](https://virtualspeech.com/learn/public-speaking-apps) For hardware, I did the same thing: I searched " What type of hardware do motivational speakers use in their presentations? " This search was pretty helpful; it got me some very helpful results, which I added to my notes. Some results were like websites like [ Gadgets every speaker must carry with them,](https://www.inc.com/melanie-deziel/3-gadgets-every-speaker-must-carry-with-them.html)[Things every speaker needs in their bag,](https://hughculver.com/tools-trade-every-speaker-needs-bag/)[essential for every presentation,](https://www.inkppt.com/post/20-essential-presentation-accessories)and[Gift for public speakers.](https://jnpmerchandising.com/gifts-for-public-speakers/)
