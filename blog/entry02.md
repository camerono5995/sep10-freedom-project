# What i found and how i found it
##### 11/4/24
### Context:
We are required to write about what we have found about software and hardware. And how we found information about software and hardware. Some ways i haave been researching information about hard and software is by using google. For looking up information about software i reasearched "What kind of software do motivational speakers use?" the results i got were "presentation software like Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides allows you to create visually compelling slideshows to accompany your speech." But this this was not something exactly what i was looking for so i switched up my research wording. I decided to search-up "What kind of apps do motivational speakers use" Then i was able to find better results of the information i was looking for. A link i found about software for my project was [skill hub] ("https://speakerhub.com/skillcamp/speakers-toolkit-must-have-tech-and-apps-modern-presenters") ,[ peptalk] ("https://apps.apple.com/us/app/peptalk-daily-self-motivation/id976885594") , [ Virtual speech] ("https://virtualspeech.com/learn/public-speaking-apps")
