# content: Brainstorm Part B
### Where I am at in the freedom project is in part B. Part be is where the students were required to look back at their notes of things that they have researched about their topic. Of things that have already been invented in the world. And then take that information to now think about a new invention that hasn't been created yet that could be useful for your topic.  We had to brainstorm a maximum of 10 inventions in our notes. For each invention, we had to add details for each new invention add explain how it works and how will this benefit the career field we researched on. That was done in one day brainstorming future inventions. The following day we pulled out our notes about part B. And then we copied and pasted all of our part B notes into the app Slack. When copying and pasting our part b into Slack we had to put our topic on top and then under our notes. The reason for doing this was for us to be able to communicate on each other's notes so we could get feedback from our classmates and be able to have more ideas to add to our notes on part b.
